# binding-tariff-trader-frontend

The public frontend for the Manage your Advance Tariff Rulings service, used to apply for Advance Tariff Rulings (ATaRs).

### Running

##### To run this Service you will need:

1) [Service Manager 2](https://github.com/hmrc/sm2) installed
2) [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org) Version `>=1.x` installed
3) [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) version `>=6.0` installed and running on port 27017
4) [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) installed and running on port 4572
5) Create an S3 bucket in localstack by using `awslocal s3 mb s3://digital-tariffs-local` within the localstack container

The easiest way to run MongoDB and Localstack for local development is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

##### To run MongoDB

```
> docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -p 27017-27019:27017-27019 --name mongodb mongo:6.9
```

##### To run Localstack and create the S3 bucket

```
> docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name localstack -e SERVICES=s3 -p4572:4566 -p8080:8080 localstack/localstack
> docker exec -it localstack bash
> awslocal s3 mb s3://digital-tariffs-local
> exit
```

#### Starting the application:

Launch services using `sm2 --start DIGITAL_TARIFFS`

If you want to run it locally:

- `sm2 --stop BINDING_TARIFF_TRADER_FRONTEND`
- `sbt run`

This application runs on port 9582.

Open `http://localhost:9582/advance-tariff-application`.

###  Authentication

The service uses the HMRC [auth-client](https://github.com/hmrc/auth-client) for authentication with Government Gateway as the authentication provider. In non production environments you will be redirected to the auth-login-stub. You can log in using the following enrolment information:

Enrolment Key: `HMRC-ATAR-ORG`

Identifier Name: `EORINumber`

Identifier Value: `<any string>`

### PDF Generation

When running the unit tests, PDFs are generated at **/test/resources/fop** using Apache FOP. These should be used to check for regressions in the layout of the PDFs generated by the service. 

### Testing

Run `./run_all_tests.sh`. This also runs scalafmt and does coverage testing. The last step will also run the a11y test that generates a report.
